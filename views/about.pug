            | Hi, my name is Danielle. Pleased to meet you! I have experience in various languages from C# to C++ to JavaScript. I'm most comfortable in front-end web development, but I'm always willing to branch out and learn more.
            | Treehouse is helping me do just that! As a Treehouse student, I've gained several skills I hope to develop and hone even further as I continue my never-ending journey of learning.
            | I'm also very interested in User Experience Design.
            | Have a position available that I might fit into?
            | Shoot me a message through email or LinkedIn.
            | Thank you!
